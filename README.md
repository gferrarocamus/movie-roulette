# Movie Roulette

This is an app where users can discover new movies to watch. It is built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using components from [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design).

## Background & Description

The concept of this app is inspired by [random movie roulette lists](https://letterboxd.com/search/lists/random+movie+roulette/) on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/).

The purpose of these lists is to help film lovers expand their horizons by watching movies that they typically wouldn't watch. Streaming services sometimes offer a lot of content that is difficult to discover organically because of the way that their algorithms push certain titles (and not others), so that's where movie roulettes come into play.

They also provide a convenient way of just choosing a movie to watch when decision fatigue strikes.

These lists typically work in the following way:
1. Use a [random number generator](https://www.random.org) to pick a number.
2. Search for the movie corresponding to that number on the list.
3. You can skip a limited number of times, after which you should watch the movie discovered.

MovieRoulette aims at serving the same purposes in a single place.
