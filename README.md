# MovieRoulette

This is an app where users can discover new movies to watch. It is built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using components from [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design).

## Background

The concept of this app is inspired by [random movie roulette lists](https://letterboxd.com/search/lists/random+movie+roulette/) on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/). In their most basic usage, movie roulettes provide a convenient way of just choosing a movie to watch when decision fatigue strikes.

These lists also help film lovers expand their horizons by encouraging them to watch movies that they typically wouldn't watch. Streaming services can offer a lot of content that is difficult to discover organically because of the way that their algorithms push certain titles (and not others), leaving viewers in a rut. That's where movie roulettes come into play, too.

Random movie roulette lists typically work in the following way:

1. Use a [random number generator](https://www.random.org) to pick a number.
2. Search for the movie corresponding to that number on the list.
3. You can skip a limited number of times, after which you should watch the movie discovered.

[MovieRoulette](https://movieroulette.herokuapp.com/) aims at serving the same purposes from a single place.

## Features

- Randomized movie recommendations based on four categories.
- Possibility to skip recommendations indefinitely.
- Unique recommendations across categories.

### Features in the Works

- Filters to narrow down recommendations by cast, crew, year, language, runtime, similar movie, etc.
- Watchlist to keep track of accepted recommendations.
- List of rejected recommendations.

### Future Features

- Toggling between limited and indefinite recommendations.
- Full-fledged user accounts.
- Richer movie data drawn from additional APIs.
